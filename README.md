A graphical user interface coded in C++ using [the Nana GUI library](http://nanapro.org/en-us/)
and Visual Studio
This GUI application allows the user to utilize many features such:
1. **Manage database for customers, vehicles and rental locations**
   - Create/delete customers consisting of their First and last Names, age and street address (e.g Mike Bj√∂rn ,38 at 4837 Zachary Blvd )
   - Create/delete rental locations consisting of A street number as well as an address and a postal code (1039 Harris Street ZE3007)
   - Create/delete vehicle consisting of car company and name (e.g Nissan Maxima)
2. **Assign Rental Location to Vehicle**
3. **Rent Car to a customer**

This GUI allows the user to add/remove vehicles, customers and rental locations, assign a vehicle to a rental location as well as allowing a customer to rent a vehicle along with other features
that will be coming soon. When executing the program, you will find that 2 vehicles, customers and rental locations have already been created. This is to give the user an idea of how
the program works without having to add a customer, vehicle and rental location from scratch. The process can be tedious because there are multiple attributes for each one.
The main project is called Final Project because this was from an assingment that i submitted as part of a course i was taking in college
