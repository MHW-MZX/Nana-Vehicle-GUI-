# Nana-Vehicle-GUI-
A graphical user interface coded in C++ using Nana GUI library and Visual Studio Enterprise Preview 2022
This GUI allows the user to add/remove vehicles, customers and rental locations, assign a vehicle to a rental location as well as allowing a customer to rent a vehicle along with other features
that will be coming soon. When executing the program, you will find that 2 vehicles, customers and rental locations have already been created. This is to give the user an idea of how
the program works without having to add a customer, vehicle and rental location from scratch. The process can be tedious because there are multiple attributes for each one.
